# This repository contains 45 infographics for world's largetst game market (countries + regions).  The infographics were created by Yingdi Qi in 2016-2017 for GMA (Game Market Analyzer, http://gmaapp.com/wordpress/) app, a free iOS app that provides market insight for game developers who aspire to publish their game globally.  The data used in all infographics were based on the key market data co-collected by DFC Intelligence (https://www.dfcint.com/) and LAI Global Game Services (https://lai.com/) in 2016.  Certain data (e.g. game software market size, the most popular game genre, etc.) may have been updated.
